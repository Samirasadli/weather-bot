# Python Weather App: Get Real-time Weather Data and Visualizations
This Python script retrieves weather data for any city and presents it in an informative and visually appealing way. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The data is then parsed and presented in a pandas DataFrame, along with three interactive visualizations created with Plotly Express:
 * Temperature Line Chart: Tracks the temperature variations throughout the day.
 * Humidity Bar Chart: Provides a clear overview of the current humidity level.
 * Wind Speed Bar Chart: Displays the wind speed at the time of data retrieval.
Key Features:
 * User-friendly interface: Simply enter a city name to get weather data.
 * Actionable insights: Receive helpful messages about potential precipitation based on the weather conditions.
 * Clear and concise output: View the data in a structured DataFrame format.
 * Engaging visualizations: Gain quick insights through interactive charts.
 * Easy to use: No complex setup required, just replace the API key and run the script.
Getting Started:
 * Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
 * Save the script as a .py file (e.g., weather_app.py).
 * Run the script from your terminal using python weather_app.py.
 * Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for.
Note: This is a basic weather app designed for educational purposes. For more advanced features and functionalities, consider exploring the vast capabilities of the OpenWeatherMap API and Plotly Express libraries.
